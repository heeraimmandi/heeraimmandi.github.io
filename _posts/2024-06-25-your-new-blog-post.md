## Lichens

This summer, I've been working as a volunteer at the Botanical Research Institute of Texas (BRIT) located in Fort Worth, Texas--specifically with the herbarium. 

I was assigned the Heber W Youngken medicinal plant collection from the Massachusetts College of Pharmacy. This collection included vascular plants and lichens collected as early as 1868. I first focused on transcribing and digitizing vascular plants, but Ashley (the collections manager) and I ended up finding a smaller collection of lichens a few weeks in.
