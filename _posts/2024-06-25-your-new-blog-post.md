## Lichens

This summer, I've been working as a volunteer at the Botanical Research Institute of Texas (BRIT) located in Fort Worth, Texas--specifically with the herbarium. 

I was assigned the Heber W Youngken medicinal plant collection from the Massachusetts College of Pharmacy. This collection included vascular plants and lichens collected as early as 1868. I first worked primarily on transcribing and digitizing vascular plants, but Ashley (the collections manager) and I ended up finding a smaller collection of Youngken's lichens a few weeks in. Lichens and the symbiotic relationship behind their existence is incredibly interesting to me. 

Heber W Youngken was a plant collector who focused on medicinal plants. Most of the plants and lichens he personally collected were on the east coast, especially Maine and New Hampshire. There were also a few from California, North Carolina, and Florida. Some of the plant and lichen specimens in his collection were from other collections. These other collections had specimens collected by Maynard W. Quimby, M.E. Gutterson, John G. Jack, R.J. Clausen, and Arthur S. Pease.
