## DISL REU

This summer, I had the incredible opportunity to work as an NSF Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) intern under Dr. Jeffrey Krause at Dauphin Island Sea Lab. My project was investigating the chemical composition of silica produced by the marine cyanobacterium Synechococcus (CCMP 1334). My work days consisted of maintaining 12 cultures of Synechococcus, sampling for biogenic silica and cell counts, completing a series of different chemical digestions (HF, HCl, and NaOH), and quantifying silica content from these digestions. 

I was originally going to try to explain my project in this post, but I am afraid of oversimplifying such complex concepts. Instead, here is my poster! If you have any questions, feel free to email me (scroll to the bottom of this site for my email).
