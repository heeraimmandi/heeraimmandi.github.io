## Canal Microbes

This August, I had the privilege of joining the <a href="https://www.neuer.lab.asu.edu/">Neuer Lab</a> as an Undergraduate Researcher. Since then, I have spent my days shadowing and assisting graduate students with their projects, completing lab maintenance tasks, and writing my experiences in my lab journal. Being part of a lab is extremely rewarding. I see cool things every day I am in there. 

One cool thing I have done recently is help make a wet mount from a sample of biocrust, or biological soil crust, found in a canal outside the lab. The biocrust was collected by Britni Livar, a PhD student at the Neuer Lab. She had rehydrated the biocrust by letting it sit in water before we got a sample.

We were unable to identify the organisms, but I found one nematode (roundworm), one platyhelminth (flatworm), and one rotifer. I also found another organism that may be a rotifer too. Maybe its a gastrotrich? I'm not sure.

I uploaded the footage to my Youtube Channel! (Click on the pictures to be redirected to the videos) <br>
