Biological Sciences major @ Arizona State University <br>

My research interests include marine microbial ecology, biogeochemical processes such  as nutrient cycling, and both physical and biological oceanography. I have been fascinated by the ocean for as long as I can remember, and I want to study the oceanographic processes that sustain life on Earth. I also prioritize scientific communication (a big reason why I run this blog), and I am always working towards a future where ocean science is more accessible and inclusive
